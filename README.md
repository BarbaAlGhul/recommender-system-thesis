# Recommender System Thesis
Deep Learning Recommender System

This is my bachelor thesis project. The project's objective is to develop a recommender system using Deep Learning with [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning), based on a system described by Zhuang et al. (2017). The project will start with a recommender system created by (BATRA, 2018), using [non-negative matrix factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization).
